Requirements:
Download Dolphin Emulator: https://dolphin-emu.org/download/
Obtain an unmodified GM5E7D Metal Arms: Glitch in the System .iso file (Do NOT ask anyone to give you one, you must find one yourself, it is not hard)


Instructions:
-Place your mod .zip file in the mods folder (Multiple mods can be installed at once, but do this at your own risk as some may be conflicting)
-Drag-and-drop the unmodified .iso over exavolt.exe
-After a moment, mod.iso will be created with your mods installed
-Open mod.iso in Dolphin and play!


Extending memory:
Exavolt.exe will automatically extend the games memory, but an extra step is required (you only have to do this once)
-In the list of games in Dolphin, right-click Metal Arms and choose Properties
-Check Speed up Disc Transfer Rate, then exit Properties
-Open Config and go to Advanced tab
-Check Enable MMU
-Under Memory Override, Check Enable Emulated Memory Size Override
-Slide the MEM1 slider all the way to the right. Leave the MEM2 slider all the way to the left.
Done!
