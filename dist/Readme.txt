Requirements:
Download Dolphin Emulator: https://dolphin-emu.org/download/
Obtain an unmodified GM5E7D Metal Arms: Glitch in the System .iso file (Do NOT ask anyone to give you one)
If you need help or have questions, join the Metal Arms Modding Discord server:
https://discord.gg/3Dztwe6Wcy


Instructions:
-Place your mod .zip file in the mods folder (Must be a .zip file containing an .mst. Multiple mods can be installed at once, but some might be conflicting)
-Drag-and-drop the unmodified .iso over exavolt.exe
-After a moment, mod.iso will be created with your mods installed
-Open mod.iso in Dolphin and play!


Extending memory:
Exavolt.exe will automatically extend the game's memory, but an extra step is required (you only have to do this once)
-in Dolphin, open Config and go to Advanced tab
-Check Enable MMU
-Under Memory Override, Check Enable Emulated Memory Size Override
-Slide the MEM1 and MEM2 sliders all the way to the right
Done!
