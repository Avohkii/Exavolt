Metal Arms game files are compiled into mettlearms_gc.mst. Exavolt only needs an mst containing your custom files as well as a json file with details about the mod to install it into the game without needing to compile any files yourself.

Setting up your mod for Exavolt:
Open Pasm and go to Edit > Configuration Settings
Change the GC Master File Dir to a new folder that does not contain an mst
Compile to create a new mst that will only contain your Local files
Put the new mst, wvb files (if your mod has any), and a manifest.json into a .zip
Refer to zstorm4's Example Post in the #mod-releases channel as a reference for sharing your mod to the Discord server.

Editing CSV files:
example_CSVedit.json shows how CSV files can be modified. The column and row where a value is stored must be specified so the new value can be written to that spot.
New lines can also be added to a csv.



"custom_inventory"
