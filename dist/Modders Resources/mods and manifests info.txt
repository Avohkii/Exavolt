Metal Arms game files are compiled into mettlearms_gc.mst. Exavolt only needs an mst containing your custom files as well as a json file with details about the mod to install it into the game without needing to compile any files yourself.

Setting up your mod for Exavolt:
Open Pasm and go to Edit > Configuration Settings
Change the GC Master File Dir to a new folder that does not contain an mst
Compile to create a new mst that will only contain your Local files
Put the new mst, wvb files (if your mod has any), and a manifest.json into a .zip
Refer to zstorm4's Example Post in the #mod-releases channel as a reference for sharing your mod.


Manifest.json info:

"hacks_required": ["extended_heap"],
This sets if the mod requires extended memory, which most mods should by default.

Levels:
If no levels are included, leave this as "levels": [],
Additional levels must be in their own sets of brackets with a comma after the closing brackets between them.

"Type" 
Can either be campaign or multiplayer. Either choice will replace an existing SP/MP level in the game with your custom level.

"Thumbnail"
Specifies the name of a .tga texture to use as the level's thumbnail.

"player_bot"
Use this to set which bot the player controls in this level. Options are Glitch, Mozer, Krunk, and Slosh. This option shouldn't be included by default since the player will normally play as Glitch anyway.
example_multiplelevels.json shows an example of how this is written.

"non_mst_files"
This is for including any files that don't belong in the mst, usually .wvs files.

04 Gecko codes can be included in your mod with "gecko_codes".
Example_04code.json shows how the following code is written in a modloader manifest:
040dcf84 90bf0d88
040dcf88 90bf0d8c
040dd2b4 907f0d8c
Additional codes can be added simply by including more "opcode" and "content" lines.

example_nonlevelmod.json is an example manifest for a mod that includes no custom levels, codes, or wvb's. Since non-level mods fall under "other mst files", all that needs to be changed is the mod title and author name.
